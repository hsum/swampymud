{
    "name" : [NAME],
    "path" : [PATH],
    "frequency" : [FREQUENCY]
}
notes:
[NAME]
the classname of the desired import, it should be defined in the script file
(this will be executed as, "from scriptname import classname")

[PATH]
the path to the script, assuming that it is called from the
highest folder in the git repository (i.e. the one containing
"scripts", "locations", "chars", etc.)

[FREQUENCY]
This is an optional field. By default, the frequency will be specified in the body of the class.
the relative frequency of players becoming this class
can be float or int
Probability that the player becomes this class is equal to
frequency / the summation of all other class frequencies

So if frequencies are Dog:1, Bird:3, Cat:6
the summation = 10
the probability of spawning as a Dog = 1 / 10
This field is optional
